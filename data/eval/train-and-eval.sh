# Usage: data/eval/train-and-eval.sh [COMMIT [BASECOMMIT]]
#
# Perform full model training and performance evaluation of the given
# commit (may be also a branch name, or nothing to eval the HEAD).
# The training and test set is processed in parallel, however the
# final answer evaluation is delayed until the model is retrained.
#
# This produces answer TSV files for training and test set
# (final, and pre-training ones with 'u' prefix before commit),
# xmi answer feature vectors file, a model parameter file and a log
# for both the train and test runs.
#
# If the evaluation has been successful, you should commit an updated
# model; that's one of the last lines printed by the list.
#
# The optional argument BASECOMMIT supports skipping phase 0 (the bulk
# of the brmson work), instead reusing data generated by BASECOMMIT
# as input for further phases.  You can use this to quickly experiment
# with late-stage pipeline parameters like size of the pruned set,
# machine learning parameters or evidence gathering improvements.
#
# Since this all involves multiple executions and we often want to
# evaluate multiple versions at once, we create a temporary clone of
# the current repo and run things there.  N.B. uncommitted changes
# are *not* tested!  The actual execution happens in the script
# `data/eval/_multistage_traineval.sh`.
