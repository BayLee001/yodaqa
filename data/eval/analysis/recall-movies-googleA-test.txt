Incorrect:
doesnt find the movie at all
*	Who directed godfather – RESULT: The query did not find the movie, works when we look for "The Godfather"
	*	when was rocky released   - FIXED bug where we didn't add clues created from subjects to the query queue
*	when was kings speech released – RESULT: when we query "King's Speech", dbpedia returns an empty concept, works when we add "the"

*	Who wrote the screenplay for the X-Men days of future past? - RESULT:
																1) DBpediaTitles doesn't ask the correct query, which is "X-Men Days of Future Past" - it is not generated
																2) in DBPediaTitles raw query, the following commands filter out the result:
																FILTER ( !BOUND(?redirTarget) )
																FILTER ( !regex(str(?res), '^http://dbpedia.org/resource/[^_]*:', 'i') )
																3) in DBPediaOntology, this query filters out the results:
																FILTER ( !regex(str(?res), '^http://dbpedia.org/resource/[^_]*:', 'i') )
																4) This is due to the ":" in "X-Men: Days of..", which we automatically filter out.
